# Shader Library Collection

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name/blob/main/LICENSE)

## Introduction

This is a collection of shaders written in HLSL using Evergine. The library provides a variety of shader effects to enhance the visual quality of your graphics applications. It includes implementations of popular effects such as Blinn-Phong, BRDF Microfacet, BRDF + IBL, IBL, Equirectangular Reflections, TextureCube Reflections, Fur shells, Explode Effect, Extrude Pyramid, Extrude Triangles, Flat shading, Fresnel, Interior Mapping, Parallax Corrected Cube Mapping, Normal Mapping, Parallax Mapping, Parallax Occlusion Mapping, Toon shading, Translucency Shading, Vertex Normals GS, and Wireframe GS.

## Shaders

- **Blinn-Phong**: Implements the classic Blinn-Phong lighting model for realistic shading and highlights.
- **BRDF Microfacet**: Offers a microfacet-based BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function) for accurate material rendering.
- **IBL**: Implements Image-Based Lighting (IBL) to achieve realistic reflections and lighting effects.
- **BRDF + IBL**: Combines BRDF with Image-Based Lighting (IBL) techniques for realistic and dynamic lighting.
- **Equirectangular Reflections**: Provides reflections based on equirectangular environment maps.
- **TextureCube Reflections**: Offers reflections using cube maps as environment maps.
- **Fur Shells**: Simulates fur or hair effects using shell rendering techniques.
- **Explode Effect**: Creates an explosion effect by manipulating vertex positions.
- **Extrude Pyramid**: Extrudes a pyramid shape from a base geometry.
- **Extrude Triangles**: Extrudes triangles along their normals to create a 3D effect.
- **Flat Shading**: Applies flat shading to achieve a low-polygon aesthetic.
- **Fresnel**: Implements Fresnel effects for reflective materials.
- **Interior Mapping**: Simulates the appearance of interiors behind windows or other surfaces.
- **Parallax Corrected Cube Mapping**: Provides improved cube map reflections with parallax correction.
- **Normal Mapping**: Enhances surface lighting and detail using normal maps.
- **Parallax Mapping**: Simulates depth on textured surfaces by offsetting texture coordinates.
- **Parallax Occlusion Mapping**: Enhances the depth simulation of Parallax Mapping with occlusion handling.
- **Toon Shading**: Applies a toon or cel-shading effect to achieve a cartoon-like rendering style.
- **Translucency Shading**: Simulates light passing through translucent materials for realistic rendering.
- **Vertex Normals GS**: Calculates vertex normals in the Geometry Shader stage for improved shading accuracy.
- **Wireframe GS**: Renders objects as wireframes using the Geometry Shader stage.
